       <h2 style="color:gray">TOP 10 MOUSE 2016</h2>
       <p style= "float:left; color:black; font-size:18px" class="text-left">First, we look at the intended use of the mouse. Is it meant for day-to-day use with a desktop PC, or for on-the-go use with a laptop or tablet? Is it a basic two-button mouse for browsing the Web, or a tricked-out gaming mouse, built for competition? Different categories have different needs, and each mouse is built to reflect the specifics of that category. Desktop mice are made for everyday use, and have the standard right and left buttons, a scroll wheel, and perhaps forward and back buttons for navigating in your Web browser. Travel mice, designed for use on the road, are usually much smaller, made to fit easily into the pocket of a laptop bag or backpack, and connect quickly without a tangle of wires. Gaming mice are an entirely different beast, eschewing simplicity in favor of customization, and offering buttons and controls that the average Facebook browser would never need. </p>

    <h3>1. Corsair Vengeance M65</h3>
    <img src="pic\moarc\top1.jpg" alt="Corsair K70 Rapidfire" class="moarc">
    <p>Armed with a laser sensor with a maximum DPI of 8,200, the M65 can be tuned to a level of hyper-sensitivity equal to that of the Roccat Kone XTD (8,200dpi). Moreover, our testing confirmed its advertised polling rate of 1,000Hz. Combine this lag-free responsiveness with a highly precise laser sensor, and you've got a solid mouse for even the most competitive of gamers.The M65 is a wired mouse that connects via a tangle-free braided USB 3.0 chord. It doesn't offer a wireless option. Moreover, its wired connection eliminates concerns over batteries and dongles, so gamers can focus entirely on more immediate concerns like blasting away foes. Corsair covers the M65 with a two-year warranty.</p>

    <h3>2. Logitech G602 Wireless Gaming Mouse</h3>
    <img src="pic\moarc\top2.jpg" alt="Razer Ornata" class="moarc">
    <p>The G602 is a right-handed mouse, with a sculpted ergonomic design, complete with a jutting wing for you to support the thumb. On the left side, handily accessible by the thumb, are six programmable buttons, ideal for macros and keybinds used during MMORPGs and similar games. Though not as numerous as the dozen buttons on the Logitech G600 MMO Gaming Mouse, the six thumb buttons found on the G602 are shaped to sit above the thumb rest, and have raised faces to make it easy to differentiate one button from another without having to look at the mouse instead of your game.On the front of the mouse, along with the standard right and left buttons, two additional buttons set on the left edge of the left button for switching DPI on the fly, easily accessible to your index finger, but out of the way enough to prevent any unwanted button presses. All of the 11 buttons on the G602 use durable mechanical switches, and are rated for more than 20 million clicks.</p>

    <h3>3. Logitech T650 Wireless Rechargeable Touchpad</h3>
    <img src="pic\moarc\top3.jpg" alt="SteelSeries Apex M800" class="moarc">
    <p>There's an awful lot of swiping, tapping, and gesturing going on with gadgets this year. The idea of the touch pad is nothing new to laptop users, but it's only recently that many have come to see it as giving a better overall experience than a traditional mouse. Part of that comes from Windows 8 and its emphasis on gesture and touch control, and part comes from Apple's excellent touch-pad implementation in MacBooks, which have outshone their PC competition in this department for years. To that end, we've seen an increasing number of all-in-one desktops, including new models from Vizio and Hewlett-Packard, include standalone touch pads rather than a mouse, and Logitech has the standalone $79 Touchpad Wireless Rechargeable Touchpad T650 for those who want to make the leap with their existing setup. A glass-topped matte black square, the 5.25-inch-by-5.1-inch T650 looks and feels a lot like Apple's excellent Magic Trackpad.</p>

    <h3>4. Cherry MX Board 6.0</h3>
    <img src="pic\moarc\top4.jpg" alt="Cherry MX Board 6.0" class="moarc">
    <p>Cherry's flagship MX Board 6.0 features a lower profile than other gaming keyboards like the Razer BlackWidow X Chroma, making it perfect if you prefer to type and game using a wrist rest. Cherry's MX Red switches under the keys lend the MX Board 6.0 fast response times, but because the keys are positioned fairly close together they're excellent for typing too. Housed in a solid aluminium chassis, the MX Board 6.0 certainly doesn't feel cheap and its blood-red key lighting is deliciously ominous. A mechanical keyboard that's also perfect for the office, then.</p>

    <h3>5. Evoluent VerticalMouse 4 for Mac</h3>
    <img src="pic\moarc\top5.jpg" alt="Corsair K95 RGB " class="moarc">
    <p>The shape is thoughtfully sculpted for uncompromised comfort and easy-to-reach programmable buttons. No finger contortions are needed to operate the buttons.Pointer speed controls on the side allow convenient adjustment without even releasing your grip from the mouse. The thumb rest has been reshaped to provide even more comfort over earlier versions.Top mounted LEDs show through the chrome thumb rest to indicate selected pointer speed including extra low (XL), low (LO), MD (medium), to high (HI).A new bottom thumb button provides greatly extended functionality when used with the included driver.The logo is pure eye candy. The illumination turns off when the system is in sleep mode to conserve notebook battery power. An extra wide lip along the bottom edge prevents the last finger from rubbing the desk.Evoluent Mouse Manager for Windows provides extensive but easy to use functionality for 6 buttons through a simple and intuitive interface.</p>

   <h3>6. Microsoft Sculpt Mobile Mouse</h3>
   <img src="pic\moarc\top6.jpg" alt="SteelSeries Apex M500 " class="moarc">
   <p>Whether you’re editing a presentation or connecting with friends online, Sculpt Mobile Mouse is a comfortable, familiar companion for your modern, mobile lifestyle. Its compact design and BlueTrack technology, which works on virtually any surface, make it the ideal device for the office or on the go. Enjoy a clutter-free workspace at your desk or on your coffee table with this wireless, mini-USB connected mouse.The classic shape of Sculpt Mobile Mouse and its 4-way scroll wheel make it intuitive to operate with either hand. Tilting the wheel left and right allows you to scroll horizontally, performing such tasks as navigating the Start screen or moving through wide documents with ease.</p>

   <h3>7. Roccat Tyon</h3>
   <img src="pic\moarc\top7.jpg" alt="Division Zero X40" class="moarc">
   <p>A dual-directional analog thumb-paddle (called the X-Celerator) can be used as either a simple two-function button, or as a dedicated control when gaming for rotating turrets, throttling speed up and down, or zooming in and out with a sniper's scope. Two thumb buttons sit just below the thumb stick, but their position is such that you won't be able to use the thumb-paddle and the buttons at the same time, so plan accordingly when mapping out your controls.A button on the back, just behind the ratcheting scroll wheel, is called the Dorsal Fin button. It lets you click to the right and the left, selecting commands without taking a finger away from the action. Doubling up functions is simple, thanks to a conveniently placed Easy-Shift [+] thumb button that lets you activate secondary functions on every other button, and even long strings of macro commands.</p>

   <h3>8. Microsoft Arc Touch Mouse Surface Edition</h3>
   <img src="pic\moarc\top8.jpg" alt="Speedlink Ultor" class="moarc">
   <p>Inspired by Surface, this special-edition Arc Touch Mouse is perfectly designed for life on the go. With reliable wireless freedom, you get a clutter-free experience that works from up to 30 feet away. Use it even on a rough wood surface or carpet, with BlueTrack Technology.1 And, it comes with native integration of Bluetooth 4.0.The touch strip on the Arc Touch Mouse Surface Edition responds precisely to the speed of your finger movement, using haptic feedback to scroll vertically.Experience comfort and elegant design in a portable mouse. Designed to match Surface, Arc Touch Mouse Surface Edition has the dark titanium finish of Surface devices. Shaped to match the natural curve of your hand, Arc Touch Mouse Surface Edition provides a comfortable, precise way to navigate your Surface. When you’re on the go, just flatten and slip into your pocket or purse.</p>

   <h3>9. Rapoo 7100P Wireless Optical Mouse</h3>
   <img src="pic\moarc\top9.jpg" alt="G.Skill Ripjaws KM780 RGB" class="moarc">
   <p>The Rapoo 7100P Wireless Optical Mouse is a good mouse for your home office or work place. It comes with a wireless USB nano receiver (about the same size as Logitech's Unifying receivers) and a CD-ROM that contains Rapoo's universal drivers for their product (I wouldn't recommend using this disc since it is outdated; just head over to their website to download the latest version).The only thing negative about this mouse (definitely annoying) is that their receivers will not pair up with more than 1 device. This is such a problem because I have Rapoo's wireless keyboard (Wireless Ultra-slim Keyboard E9070) as well and they have the exact same receivers, however I cannot use one of them to link both devices. I have to use 2 USB ports just to link the devices (even tho the USB nano receivers are identical). They need to get this fixed, it would be truly nice to free up USB ports. </p>

   <h3>10. Logitech Wireless Mouse M560</h3>
   <img src="pic\moarc\top10.jpg" alt="Corsair K95 RGB " class="moarc">
   <p>This mouse is a good size and heft. It "feels" good in your hand and functions well on day-to-day basic activities. After the first hour or two my index finger was a bit sore but that's due to the different size of the wheel. After a day of work this went away as my finger got used to the configuration and shape. I tested the mouse on 4 different systems and OSes using it a full day. One of those is my primary work system that's used fairly constantly on the internet doing research and support work and the other is my primary home system. Those two systems are are running Windows 7 and Windows XP.Windows 7 - Works well, even without the software package. The pre-programed buttons do some interesting, and occasionally useful, functions. The front-left button brings up the "Start" menu. The front-rear button minimizes *all* applications to the task bar and the 2nd press brings them all back up to their previous status/position. The wheel-left and wheel-right buttons work in browsers as "back" and "forward" buttons on a web page - this is nice but not something I use often.</p>
